An introduction to the `graph-lib` types...

## Nodes

Graph nodes are simple objects with only an `id` property.

```typescript
type Node = {
    id: string
}
```

All node IDs in a [Graph](#graph) must be unique among all other nodes. Furthermore, once a node has been placed into a
graph by using, for example, the [`newGraph()`](#newGraph) function, all properties will be marked as `readonly`.

Nodes can be extended with additional properties using the TypeScript generic syntax. For example, if we want to use
nodes that have x- and y-coordinates, we can do the following:

```typescript
type Vector2 = {
    x: number
    y: number
}

type PositionedNode = Node<Vector2>

const node: PositionedNode = {
    id: 'a',
    x: 0,
    y: 0
};
```

Nodes defined this way will carry their types with them as they flow through the various `graph-lib` functions. So if
you use [`getNode()`](#getNode) to retrieve a node from a graph you created using the `PositionedNode` type,
TypeScript will understand that the returned node is a `PositionedNode`.

## Edges

Graph edges are simple objects that describe the connectivity of two nodes. They have an `id` property, and `source`
and `target` properties which refer to two node IDs.

```typescript
type Edge = {
    id: string
    source: string
    target: string
}
```

All edge IDs in a [Graph](#graph) must be unique among all other edges. Furthermore, once an edge has been placed into
a graph by using, for example, the [`newGraph()`](#newGraph) function, all properties will be marked as `readonly`.

Edges can be extended with additional properties using the TypeScript generic syntax. For example, if we want to assign
a numeric weight to edges, we can do the following:

```typescript
interface Weighted {
    weight: number
}

type WeightedEdge = Edge<Weighted>

const edge: WeightedEdge = {
    id: 'ab',
    source: 'a',
    target: 'b',
    weight: 42
};
```

Edges defined this way will carry their types with them as they flow through various `graph-lib` functions. So if
you use [`getEdge()`](#getEdge) to retrieve an edge from a graph you created using the `WeightedEdge` type,
TypeScript will understand that the returned edge will is a `WeightedEdge`.

## Graphs

Graphs are composed of [nodes](#node) and [edges](#edge). Graph objects are never manually created; rather, the
[`newGraph()`](#newGraph) function is used to create an empty graph (or a graph from some existing nodes and edges).

Graphs are immutable and you should never attempt to directly modify a graph object.

Graphs created using `Node` or `Edge` types that have been extended with additional properties will automatically carry
those types with them. For example, using the `PositionedNode` and `WeightedEdge` types from above:

```typescript
const a: PositionedNode = { id: 'a', x: 1, y: 0 };
const b: PositionedNode = { id: 'b', x: 0, y: 1 };
const ab: WeightedEdge = { id: 'ab', source: 'a', target: 'b', weight: 100 };

// graph has type Graph<PositionedNode, WeightedEdge>
const graph = newGraph([a, b], [ab]);
```
