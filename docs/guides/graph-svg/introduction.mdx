import { TabbedCodeBlock } from '../../../src/components/TabbedCodeBlock';
import { GraphContainer } from '../../../src/components/GraphContainer';
import { ResponsiveGraph } from '../../../src/components/ResponsiveGraph';
import { basicGraph } from './introduction/basicGraph';
import { styles0 } from './introduction/basicStyles';
import { shape0 } from './introduction/basicShapes';

This is an introduction. It's got some stuff in it.

<GraphContainer height={300}>
    <ResponsiveGraph
        graph={basicGraph}
        defaultShape={shape0}
        {...styles0}/>
</GraphContainer>

And here we have some code in both TypeScript and JavaScript:

<TabbedCodeBlock>

```typescript
console.log('ts');
```

```javascript
console.log('js');
```

</TabbedCodeBlock>
