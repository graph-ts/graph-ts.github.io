## Types

### `Node<T>` {#node}

### `Edge<T>` {#edge}

### `Graph<N, E>` {#graph}

## Creating Graphs

### `newGraph(nodes?, edges?)` {#newGraph}

Create a new graph from an existing set of nodes and edges. If no nodes or edges are provided, an empty graph is
created. All node IDs must be unique among nodes and edge IDs must be unique among edges. All edge source and target
node IDs must refer to nodes in the `nodes` array.

**Type Definitions:**

```newGraph(nodes?: Node[], edges?: Edge[]): Graph```

**Arguments:**
* `nodes`: (Optional) An array of [Nodes](#node)
* `edges`: (Optional) An array of [Edges](#edge)

**Returns:**

A [Graph](#graph) composed of all provided nodes and edges.

**Examples:**

```typescript
const a: Node = { id: 'a' };
const b: Node = { id: 'b' };
const ab: Edge = { id: 'ab', source: 'a', target: 'b' };

// An empty graph
const graph: Graph = newGraph();

// A graph with one node
const graph: Graph = newGraph([a]);

// A graph with two nodes and one edge
const graph: Graph = newGraph([a, b], [ab]);
```

## Editing Graphs

The functions in this section all create a new graph by editing an existing graph. Because graphs are immutable,
they are never actually "edited". Rather, a new graph is produced to reflect the result of the desired change.

### `addEdge(graph, edge)` {#addEdge}

Add an edge to a graph. The new edge ID must be unique among all existing edge IDs, and the new edge's source and target
node IDs must refer to nodes that already exist in the graph.

**Type Definitions:**

`addEdge(graph: Graph, edge: Edge): Graph`

**Arguments:**
* `graph`: A [Graph](#graph) object
* `edge`: An [Edge](#edge) object

**Returns:**

A new [Graph](#graph) with the added edge

### `addEdges(graph, edges)` {#addEdges}

Add multiple edges to a graph. All new edge IDs must be unique among each other and all existing edge IDs. All new edge
source and target node IDs must refer to nodes that already exist in the graph.

**Type Definitions:**

`addEdges(graph: Graph, edges: Edge[]): Graph`

**Arguments:**
* `graph`: A [Graph](#graph) object
* `edges`: An array of [Edge](#edge) objects

**Returns:**

A new [Graph](#graph) with the added edges

### `addNode(graph, node)` {#addNode}

Add a node to a graph. The new node ID must be unique among all existing node IDs.

**Type Definitions:**

`addNode(graph: Graph, node: Node): Graph`

**Arguments:**
* `graph`: A [Graph](#graph) object
* `node`: A [Node](#node) object

**Returns:**

A new [Graph](#graph) with the added node

### `addNodes(graph, nodes)` {#addNodes}

Add multiple nodes to a graph. All new node IDs must be unique among each other and all existing node IDs.

**Type Definitions:**

`addNodes(graph: Graph, nodes: Node[]): Graph`

**Arguments:**
* `graph`: A [Graph](#graph) object
* `nodes`: An array of [Node](#node) objects

**Returns:**

A new [Graph](#graph) with the added nodes
