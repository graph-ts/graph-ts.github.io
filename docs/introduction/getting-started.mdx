Why do you need it?

How can it be used?

## The Graph TS Libraries

Here is a brief description of each of the Graph TS libraries.

## Basic Examples

### Working With Graphs

Graphs are created and manipulated using the [```graph-lib```](https://github.com/graph-ts/graph-lib) library.
The basic building blocks of graphs are nodes and edges which have the following shape:

```typescript
type Node {
  id: string // a unique node ID
}

type Edge {
  id: string      // a unique edge ID
  source: string  // a node ID
  target: string  // a node ID
}
```

To create a graph from a set of nodes and edges, use the ```newGraph()``` function, which accepts an array of nodes
and an array of edges as parameters.

<TabbedCodeBlock>

```typescript
import { newGraph, Graph, Node, Edge } from '@graph-ts/graph-lib';

const a: Node = { id: 'a' };
const b: Node = { id: 'b' };
const ab: Edge = { id: 'ab', source: 'a', target: 'b' };

const graph0: Graph = newGraph([a, b], [ab]);
```

```javascript
import { newGraph } from '@graph-ts/graph-lib';

const a = { id: 'a' };
const b = { id: 'b' };
const ab = { id: 'ab', source: 'a', target: 'b' };

const graph0 = newGraph([a, b], [ab]);
```

</TabbedCodeBlock>

In ```graph-lib```, nodes, edges, and the graphs that they constitute are immutable. So when we need to
update a graph by, for example, adding nodes and edges, instead of modifying the existing graph,
we create a new one. Continuing the example above:

<TabbedCodeBlock>

```typescript
import { addNodes, addEdges } from '@graph-ts/graph-lib';

const c: Node = { id: 'c' };
const d: Node = { id: 'd' };
const cd: Edge = { id: 'cd', source: 'c', target: 'd' };
const ac: Edge = { id: 'ac', source: 'a', target: 'c' };

// Nodes must be added to the graph before any edges that connect them
const graph1 = addNodes(graph0, [c, d]);
const graph2 = addEdges(graph1, [cd, ac]);

graph0 === graph1; // false
graph1 === graph2; // false
```

```javascript
import { addNodes, addEdges } from '@graph-ts/graph-lib';

const c = { id: 'c' };
const d = { id: 'd' };
const cd = { id: 'cd', source: 'c', target: 'd' };
const ac = { id: 'ac', source: 'a', target: 'c' };

// Nodes must be added to the graph before any edges that connect them
const graph1 = addNodes(graph0, [c, d]);
const graph2 = addEdges(graph1, [cd, ac]);

graph0 === graph1; // false
graph1 === graph2; // false
```

</TabbedCodeBlock>

To work with graphs, ```graph-lib``` provides numerous methods for accessing graph components and for graph traversal.

<TabbedCodeBlock>

```typescript
import { getNodes, getEdges, breadthFirst } from '@graph-ts/graph-lib';

// Retrieve the nodes and edges
const nodes: Node[] = getNodes(graph2); // [a, b, c, d]
const edges: Edge[] = getEdges(graph2); // [ab, cd, ac];

/**
 * Get an array of nodes in breadth-first traversal
 * order starting at node 'a'.
 */
const bfo: Node[] = breadthFirst(graph, 'a'); // [ab, ac, cd];

/**
 * Traverse the graph in breadth-first order starting
 * at node 'a', printing node IDs along the way.
 */
breadthFirst(graph2, 'a', (node: Node) => {
  console.log(node.id);
});
```

```javascript
import { getNodes, getEdges, breadthFirst } from '@graph-ts/graph-lib';

// Retrieve the nodes and edges
const nodes = getNodes(graph2); // [a, b, c, d]
const edges = getEdges(graph2); // [ab, cd, ac];

/**
 * Get an array of nodes in breadth-first traversal
 * order starting at node 'a'.
 */
const bfo = breadthFirst(graph, 'a'); // [ab, ac, cd];

/**
 * Traverse the graph in breadth-first order starting
 * at node 'a', printing node IDs along the way.
 */
breadthFirst(graph2, 'a', node: => {
  console.log(node.id);
});
```
